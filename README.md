Large multimodal models have demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities in vision and language tasks, and they
have the potential to encode extensive world knowledge. However, it remains an open challenge for these models to
perceive, reason, plan, and act in realistic environments. In this work, we introduce Can-Do, a benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate embodied planning abilities through more diverse and complex scenarios than previous datasets. Our
dataset includes 315 multimodal samples, each consisting of natural language user instructions, visual images depicting
the environment, state changes, and corresponding action plans. The data encompasses diverse aspects of commonsense
knowledge, physical understanding, and safety awareness. Our fine-grained analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models,
including GPT-4V, face bottlenecks in visual perception, comprehension, and reasoning abilities.
